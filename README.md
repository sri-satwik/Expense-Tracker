## Quick Description of app
<ul>
<li>This app includes the common expense tracking features such as a total budget and expenses counter as well as transaction history.   </li>
<li>The user is able to reset both budget and expenses amount as well as delete a transaction. After a transaction is deleted the effect it had on the budget / expenses is undone.  </li>
<li>Clicking on a transaction reveals more information about it as well as giving the user the ability to delete the transaction.  </li>
<li>The app also includes the ability to categorize expenses. The user can pick out of 3 pre-existing categories or create their own.  </li>
<li>The user is also able to view their Budget and Expenses in a pie chart to easily visualize their financial state.  </li>
<li>The user is also able to select either a dark or light theme for their app.  </li>
<li>All user's data is stored in their browser's local storage.  </li>
</ul>

## Steps going forward
<ul>
<li>I plan to learn how to use Redux for state management.  </li>
<li>I plan to experience with other UI libraries such as Material UI and Chakara UI.  </li>
<li>I plan to make this app mobile responsive throught CSS media queries or using TailwindCSS  </li>
<li>I plan to learn how to add a backend to the expense tracker app and use a database (most likely MongoDB) to store the data instead of local storage.  </li>
</ul>
